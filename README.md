# Tailwind Traders Reference Deployment

This sample deploys the Tailwind Traders application across Azure services such as Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Azure Storage, and Azure Kubernetes Service.

In order to deploy this template, you need an Azure Service Principal. If needed, use the `az ad sp create-for-rbac` command to create the service principal. See [az ad sp create-for-rbac](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/ad/sp?WT.mc_id=none-github-nepeters&view=azure-cli-latest#az-ad-sp-create-for-rbac) for more information.
